Exercise 15 — Tasks

    This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005
        DELETE FROM movies
        WHERE YEAR < 2005;

    Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him.
        DELETE FROM movies
        WHERE DIRECTOR = "Andrew Stanton";

Exercise 16 — Tasks
    Create a new table named Database with the following columns:
        – Name A string (text) describing the name of the database
        – Version A number (floating point) of the latest version of this database
        – Download_count An integer count of the number of times this database was downloaded
        This table has no constraints. 

        CREATE TABLE DATABASE (
            ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            NAME TEXT,
            VERSION FLOAT,
            DOWNLOAD_COUNT INTEGER
        );

Exercise 17 — Tasks
    Add a column named Aspect_ratio with a FLOAT data type to store the aspect-ratio each movie was released in.
        ALTER TABLE MOVIES
        ADD COLUMN Aspect_ratio FLOAT;

    Add another column named Language with a TEXT data type to store the language that the movie was released in. Ensure that the default for this language is English.
        ALTER TABLE MOVIES
        ADD COLUMN Language TEXT
            DEFAULT English;

Exercise 18 — Tasks
    We've sadly reached the end of our lessons, lets clean up by removing the Movies table
        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVIES;

    And drop the BoxOffice table as well
        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BOXOFFICE;
